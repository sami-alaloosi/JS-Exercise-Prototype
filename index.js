  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  this.isFlying = true;

  TASK 1

    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, the value of this inside of that function will be the window object.

  2. Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.

  3. Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.

  4. Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.
